# GSC Magic

GSC Magic is a hosted MCP server. Its tools read the user's own search data; nothing is scraped or estimated.
Cursor may show the tools with a server prefix; this skill uses the bare names.

## Before the first call

- Cursor signs in through GSC Magic's own page (Google or e-mail): in Settings → Tools & MCP click
  Connect (or "Needs login") next to gsc-magic. A user without an
  account can create one at https://app.gscmagic.com/login?mode=signup. After signing in they pick
  which Search Console properties to import.
- Only properties imported in the GSC Magic dashboard (and allowed by the plan) are visible. If a site
  is missing, tell the user to add it at https://app.gscmagic.com/sites rather than guessing a URL.
- Bing needs the user's Bing API key and GA4 needs a property linked to the site, both in
  https://app.gscmagic.com/sources. A "not connected" error means that step is missing.

## How to work

1. Discover first: `gsc_list_sites`, then `ga_list_properties` or `bing_list_sites` if the question needs them.
2. Prefer the finished reports over raw rows when the question is analytical:
   - `report_quick_wins`: queries in positions 4 to 20 with many impressions
   - `report_traffic_drops`: biggest page/query losers and winners between two periods
   - `report_content_decay`: pages losing traffic over months
   - `report_cannibalization`: several pages competing for one query
   - `report_ctr_outliers`: pages with a CTR far below their position's norm
   - `report_brand_split`: brand vs non-brand traffic
   - `report_index_health`: sitemap URLs checked against the index
   - `report_google_vs_bing`: the same pages in both engines
3. Use `gsc_query_analytics` for custom cuts (dimensions date, query, page, country, device, filters).
   Use `gsc_inspect_url` for one URL's index status, `cwv_get_origin` / `cwv_history` / `psi_run_audit`
   for speed, `ga_run_report` for GA4 metrics.
4. Pass `chart: true` on `gsc_query_analytics` (with the `date` dimension), `report_traffic_drops`,
   `report_quick_wins`, `cwv_history`, `ga_run_report` or `bing_rank_traffic_stats` to get a PNG chart.
5. Search Console data lags 2 to 3 days. Compare equal periods (last 28 days vs the 28 before), treat
   small numbers as noise, and say when a result was truncated or hit a quota.

## Writes

Everything is read-only unless the user turned on write mode in GSC Magic (paid plans only). Write
tools include `gsc_submit_sitemap`, `gsc_delete_sitemap`, `gsc_add_site`, `gsc_delete_site`,
`bing_submit_urls`, `bing_submit_sitemap`, `bing_fetch_url`, the Bing site settings tools and
`indexnow_submit`. Every tool carries `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` annotations. Never call a
write tool without the user's explicit go-ahead for that exact action.

## Ready-made workflows

The server also offers MCP prompts: `weekly_seo_report`, `find_quick_wins`, `diagnose_traffic_drop`,
`indexing_audit`, `content_refresh_plan`, `core_web_vitals_check`.

## Limits

Free: 1 site, 200 tool calls a month and 10 a day, 14 days of stored history. Pro and Agency: no call
limit. A limit error names the plan; point the user to https://app.gscmagic.com/billing instead of retrying.
